# LLMVerse
LLMs are agents in a LLM powered world exploring, learning, growing, old, and building the world

## Objective 
Explore the interactions between multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) within a simulated environment to understand their collaborative and competitive behaviors, decision-making processes, and the emergent dynamics that result from their interactions.
